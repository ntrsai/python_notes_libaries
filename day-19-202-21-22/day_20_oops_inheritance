Python OOP Concepts: Inheritance
====================================================

Inheritance -->
Inheritance allows one class (child/derived class) 
to acquire the properties and methods of another 
class (parent/base class).

It promotes code reusability and modular design.

Why Use Inheritance?
1. Avoids code duplication.
2. Promotes reusability and maintainability.
3. Helps in designing real-world models (e.g., Car inherits from Vehicle).

Types of Inheritance in Python
--------------------------------
1. Single Inheritance → One child inherits from one parent.
2. Multiple Inheritance → One child inherits from multiple parents.
3. Multilevel Inheritance → A chain of inheritance (Child → Parent → Grandparent).
4. Hierarchical Inheritance → Multiple children inherit from one parent.
5. Hybrid Inheritance → Combination of different inheritance types.

Python uses Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide
which parent’s method to call in multiple inheritance.

Check MRO using: print(ClassName.mro())
